          <h4><b>Description:</b></h4>
          <p>The Seagate Expansion portable drive is compact and perfect for taking with you on the go. Add more storage space to your computer instantly and take large files with you when you travel. Setup is straightforward, simply connect a single USB cable and you are ready to go. The drive is powered from the USB cable, so there is no need for an external power supply. Plus, it is automatically recognised by the Windows operating system, so there is no software to install and nothing to configure. Saving files is easy â€” simply drag and drop. Take advantage of the fast data transfer speeds with the USB 3.0 interface by connecting to a SuperSpeed USB 3.0 port. USB 3.0 is backward compatible with USB 2.0 for additional system compatibility.</p>
